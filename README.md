### Some of the key features of the Practical :
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator can perform the four basic arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - using a set of buttons that allow the user to input numbers and operators.

2. Advanced Mathematical Functions: Many JavaScript calculators also include advanced mathematical functions such as square roots, exponents, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.

3. Memory Functions: Some calculators include memory functions such as storing values and recalling them later, or the ability to perform calculations based on previously stored values.

4. User Interface: The user interface of a JavaScript calculator is typically designed to be user-friendly, with clear labels and buttons that allow for easy input of numbers and operators.

5. Error Handling: A well-designed calculator will have error handling features that help prevent common mistakes, such as dividing by zero or entering an invalid character.

6. Responsive Design: With the rise of mobile devices, many JavaScript calculators are designed with responsive design, which means they can adapt to different screen sizes and still function properly.
